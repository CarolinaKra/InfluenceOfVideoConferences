# Influence Of Video Conferences
# A DataViz and Qualitative Analysis Project
This project analyses the influence of Video Conferencing During Pandemics. This was based on a survey conducted in December 2020, in the middle of the Covid-19 Pandemic, and 250 participants took part of it.

## Project Overview
* Analysed the Influence of Video Conferencing on society during the Covid-19 Pandemic 
* Set Research Question, Motivation and Objectives
* Designed and Conducted a self-administered survey
* Cleaned and Prepared the Data for Analysis
* Analysed Data with Tables, Visualisations and Correlation Calculations
* Concluded that Video Concferencing brings a great benefit for the society in the way that people can connect and the way that individuals can develop, especially during the pandemic
* Predicted that in the future post-pandemic, the population will use Video Concferencing less frequently than the time during pandemic, and it will continue to be an important tool for work and study purposes.

## Code and Resources Used
* **Python version:** 3.7
* **Packages:** matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, pandas, numpy, re

## Research Questions
1. Explore the use of video conference meetings (VCM) by the different population groups as a replacement of face-to-face meetings
during the pandemic.
2. Understand peopleâ€™s satisfaction with VC in comparison to face-to-face meetings.
3. Evaluate the personal benefits of VC during the pandemic.
4. Attempt to predict the use of VC in the future post-pandemic.

## Final Conclusions
Since the beginning of the pandemic, Video Conferece Meetings has been part of the daily activities in society. It helps people stay connected and continue their occupation such as studying and working as well as having leisure activities.

I could see that most of the people use Video Conferencing every day, meet between 4 and 7 people in a meeting which can take between 30 minutes and one hour. I learnt how the youngsters and the elders use Video Conferencing differently than the intermediate age groups.

Even though people are disappointed by the decrease on personal and affective contact, they are somewhat satisfied with Video Conferencing and find it useful that they can meet with many people that are in different places and they don't need to spend money and time travelling.

I have seen that Video Conferencing kept the society connected which helped them cope with social distancing by a reasonable amount. In addition, for almost a third of the population, Video Conferencing has stimulated their personal development, mostly by developing their technological skills.

I predicted that in the future post-pandemic, the population will use Video Conferencing less frequently than the time during pandemic, and it will continue to be an important tool for work and study purposes.

I concluded that Video Conferencing brings a great benefit for the society in the way that people can connect and the way that individuals can develop, especially during the pandemic.

This work could inspire the development of novel Video Concferencing applications which could help connect between people around the globe and help more people develop personally and professionally.
